New to blogging not sure what I want to put here. 50 years old and still trying to find my way. Had some successes and many failures. Diagnosed with more than 1 mental health issue but the predominate ones are depression and cPTSD. 

This blog will be about my struggles to get back to a place I found a few years ago where exercise, healthy eating, a building on successes had brought me to a place where my mental health wasn't a curse but something to be aware of, where it no longer held me back but was something I pushed through and where I was opening and actively trying to find an build relationships with people.

### More Information

Discovered Spartan in 2018 and successfully completed a Sprint, Super and Beast that year for my trifecta.

Found a love for trail running and successfully ran a 50 km @ Sulpher Springs and a 50 miler at Haliburton forest in 2019. 

Was training for a 100 miler in 2020 but covid had other plans.
