New to blogging not sure what I want to put here. 50 years old and still trying to find my way. Had some successes and many failures. Diagnosed with more than 1 mental health issue but the predominate ones are depression and cPTSD. 

This blog will not be for the faint of heart, I'm open about my past and how I'm living/struggling today. This hopefully will be cathartic for me and allow me to process stuff that's been haunting me for years. 

### More Information

Discovered Spartan in 2018 and successfully completed a Sprint, Super and Beast that year for my trifecta.

Found a love for trail running and successfully ran a 50 km @ Sulpher Springs and a 50 miler at Haliburton forest in 2019. 

Was training for a 100 miler in 2020 but covid had other plans.
