title: Welcome to my blog - Some background

Welcome to my blog. In here I hope to journal my return to fitness after sustaining a over training injury that has since turned into what I can only call a major depression and general returning to old behavoirs and feelings that predated my exercise journey. 

Earlier this year I was training for a 100 mile race, had switched to a plant based diet, was feeling more confident and was in a better place emotionally and spiritually. 

Most of the year I was running more than 60km a week, usually 80-100km a week. My weekends would see me running back to back and sometimes back for 40-60 just on weekends mostly on trails. My week I would run locally and typically ran 8-10 km when I went out. I love running, it's something that makes me feel good, puts my world into perspective, provides spirituality, gets me out of the house, enjoying fresh air, mother nature and help me to finally have something that I owned. I did it because I loved it and wanted to.

The issue was I wasn't stretching, wasn't really taking care of myself and allowed myself to get injured from overuse and a lack of self care. I'm the runner who sits at his desk working, jumps up throws some cloths on and heads out for a 8-10 km run, comes home eats a freezie to cool down, makes some kind of food and sits back down at my desk hunched over a laptop for another few hours. 

Weekends I'd wake, eat, drive to some trail and run 20-25 km, jump in the car, go grab something to eat, head home and sit on the couch the rest of the day. As a loner with a limited social circle I don't socialize a lot but part of my successes earlier this year was working on starting to build some new relationships and having the confidence to even try and to trust again. 

Covid, had other plans. It took away the opportuntiy to develop or build new relationships so that had a huge impact on me as well but I was working my way through it.

With this blog I hope to accomplish a few things.

* Document my return to fitness and the steps I'm taking
* Document my return to health eating
* Hold myself accountable by journalling daily

Some of the work has already started and some will be starting tomorrow.
