title: My First Post

Welcome to my first blog! Lately I find myself writing out these long posts on facebook about events and changes that are going on in my life. Most of that stuff slowly disappears and when I go back to look at it or reflect on it I find it's pushed down so far that I can't retrieve it. This will allow me to post stuff and later go back and reflect on those post.

This could be super positive, very negative and run the gambit of emotions. For sure it will shock some, for some they may nod their head in understanding and for others it will help explain some of my behavoirs and who I am. 

For years people have told me I should write a book, my life has taken so many twists and turns that some feel writing it down would help me and possibly help others. As I venture into the world of Ultra running I see many who have done just that and shared stuff that helped me so it's my turn to try and do the same. 

No 2 people's stories are the same and no 2 people would/will make the same decisions. My story is a story of pain, hurt, anger and a lot of bad decisions that eventually turned into better decisions and ultimately I'm now making wiser decisions. 

What I end up writing could be something that's happening in the here and now but likely will be something that's happened in the past. I've never processed my past, I've never really talked about it, some people are aware but no one person knows everything or even really how I got to be where I am today. 

I hope this helps someone and more so I hope it helps me to take that final step towards forgiving and letting go. I don't live in the past, I live in the consequences of mental health and my past. I'm a ruminator and a dweller. I spend far to much time in my head with my voices ruminating on stuff and dwelling on what ifs. 

I hope putting this out into the universe helps me to release it from inside me and let something else in.
