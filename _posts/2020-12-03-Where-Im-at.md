## Where I'm at

So this will be a quick overview of where I'm at and be something I can look back at and assess how things are getting better. I have to be careful and not set my expectations to high but I do have a lot of hope that I can turn this around sooner, rather than later. 

Today I'm about 20 lbs over where I was back end of Aug. I'm coming in at a nice 173 lbs and was bouncing between 146-152 throughout most of the summer. I did put on some weight due to muscle growth after the gym opened but my cloths don't fit anymore. You know you have a problem when your hoodies feel tight and you need to go out and by new pants cause none fit anymore. 

I'm consuming 3 or 4 coffees a day, eating chocolate chips by the bag in a evening overnight, drinking pop daily, cookies and other sweets. I'm not as bad as before but it certainly contributes to my weight gain. 

I've stopped eating plant based, and am now eating more comfort foods and more ofter than ever before. I'm always snacking, grabbing at food and I'm always craving sugary stuff at night. 

Most importantly I'm NOT exercising. I'm not running, I've even stopped walking. I don't like virtual classes. I have been meeting a trainer for last 2 weeks to work on mobility and try deal with my gait so I can warm up properly, run again and know what stretches benefit me the most. 

This has all lead to a lowered self esteem to the point I don't want to leave my house I'm ashamed of myself and how I look. I haven't left my house since Sat and today's Thursday. I am going out later today to meet someone as that's the only time I seem to leave right now is if I have to meet someone. 

## The Plan

Today's Thursday Dec 3rd. I'll publish at some point today and post it to my facebook. Going forward I'll update it daily for the next month. I have a life coach/nutritionist to help me focus and get mynutrition back on track, I have my trainer from One Academy to continue working on mobility and I have committed to myself a desire to get my world back into a better place. 

That means:

* getting up at a regular time 6:30
* warming up / stretching & going out for a walk/run first thing in the morning
* eating proper breakfasts and reducing my coffee/tea/sugar intake
* working until noon
* going out for another walk at lunch then eating a healthy lunch away from my computer
* working until 5 
* possibly another walk to loosen up or some stretching/yoga 
* making a nutritious meal for supper, using cooking as a way to spend some time on my feet and active, 
* baking a few nights a week
* puzzles, reading more
* no laptop, limited phone 
* regular bedtime routine, with more reading in bed 

What about weekends:

* I need to find activities for weekends, any volunteers
* commited to 1 hike out of town every weekend
* eventually I'll be long running again 

Stuff I need to look out for:

* Figure out how to get through my holiday's without reverting to old patterns, I have to take the last 2 weeks of Dec off
* making excuses to not do stuff (tired, of course I am, hungry, find something healthy)
* not following through (if I do miss something don't use that to decide I've failed and not try again)
* over injury, expectations
* using work as an excuse, very easy for me to use work to not follow through with another task but the reality is I don't have anything that can't wait

## Goals by end of Dec 2020

- Followed the plan as laid out above, with adjustments as warranted
- solid morning routine of stretching, walk/running 
- Running 30-40 km a week last week of Dec
- Blue Mountain a few times
