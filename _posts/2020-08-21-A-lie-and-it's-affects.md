title: A lie and its effects
---

I hate liars, I hate people who think that lying is an acceptable form of protecting someone you love. A lie never protects that person, the truth always comes out and the person you were trying to protect can be damaged for life.
 
My life was a fairly good life. I was raised with morals, taught about values, shown integrity and believed in good vs evil. I believed people, took them for their word and wasn't really exposed to liars until later.
 
My parents were typical of the time, punishment was being grounded, writing hundreds if not thousands of lines, not being allowed to attend special events and the strap. Dad had this piece of leather and would make you hold out your hand to smack it, pulling back resulted in more punishment. This was normal, even typical for that time and generation. Later it got out of hand but that is for another post. This one could be mind numbingly long and cover decades.
 
There are 2 lies that defined my life and took away my future. Other lies later on in life only served to retraumatize me, remind me of the first ones and set me back more than a decade and I'm only now recovering from that one.
 
Some context. I'm the first born and come from a military family with my uncles, grandparents having served or were serving at the time. Typical to those times fathers usually named their son's after themselves. So I was named after my father BUT so was my brother. I also had brown eyes and hair like my mother but both my younger brothers were blondish with blue eyes I believe.
 
When we were younger my parents decided to foster some kids to help pay the bills as being a soldier didn't really pay all that well and they wanted to save up to buy a home one day.
 
Between the sharing of first names with my brother, the difference in our appearance and this fostering I ended up asking my parents if I was adopted or not their son. They responded that wasn't the case and I was their son and I immediately put that behind me and don't think I ever thought of it again to be honest. This would turn out to be lie number 1 and I was somewhere between 8-9 yrs old.
 
Fast forward a few years, I was a very troubled kid. Always in trouble at school, had moved a few times in 3 years, wasn't really good at making friends by that time and my mother had gotten me a job that ultimately delivered me to my sexual abuser on a platter. Her words to me in front of him is do everything he asks or I'll have your father deal with you and I'm afraid to say he used that power / threat over me very well and for more than a year before we moved again.
 
Ultimately we ended up moving to a home with a basement bedroom for me, with bars on the windows and a huge heavy door with a lock on the door. To be honest by this time I was a significant flight risk on a good day.
 
So for some reason and there could be a multitude I don't recall why I was locked in my room on a Saturday probably hating life, my parents and hoping to get back to school on Monday so I could skip and go get high with some friends I'd made in the 4 or 5 weeks since I started school there.
 
My parents were fighting, their room was above mine and my mom came downstairs, unlocked my door, opened it and said something like "Pack your bags I'm taking you to your grandmothers, I'm tired of him abusing you, he's not even your father" Turned around, relocked the door and went back upstairs.
 
I had questions, lots of questions, I had anger and I banged on that door for what seemed like forever but eventually I settled down I think. Later that day my mom came back down, unlocked the door, opened it, gave me supper and told me to forget everything she had said, she then turned around and locked me back in the room.
 
But it gets better, I don't really remember the next 24-36 hours. I do recall going to school on Monday, going to my counselor at school and telling him I needed to leave the school grounds and go see my social worker. By this time I had been suspended so much for skipping that I had been told if I left the school again without permission I would be kicked out. He reminded me of this, told me I couldn't leave and I walked out and went to see my social worker.
 
She called my mom and told her I was there and that I had let her know what had happened over the weekend. She asked my mom if Tom my birth certificate dad was my father and she lied and said yes, she told the worker I was lying and sent me home they would deal with it.
 
Well I haven't really lived at home since that day. I may have spent a few weeks/months until I was 15 or so but that was the beginning of the end. My father beat me, my school kicked me out and I was left with so many questions and no answers. I had everything I knew ripped away that day. My history, my family, everything. I couldn't believe her when she said she was angry and made it all up, deep down I knew she actually told me the truth that day.
 
That lie, made me question everything I was ever told or taught up to that point. See I remembered asking them when I was younger and that lie. So how could I believe or trust anything. The anger from that spilled into everything, I lashed out, I hurt my family, I disowned my brothers (I never told them until they were much older, as much as I hated my parents I did love my brothers and I couldn't destroy their lives to get even, I just didn't have that much hate).
 
That fall I spiraled out of control, was kicked out of 3 high schools (grade 9) and by christmas was arrested for shoplifting and in Jan arrested for break and enter and my life as a junior thug had started. No one believed me, everything believed my parents, soldiers don't lie, moms don't lie, children with drug habits who skip school do. See I also never told anyone about the sexual abuse. I couldn't trust anyone, I didn't know who would believe me.
 
I was a walking, talking textbook sexually abused kid who couldn't trust his parents or the system. I would be punished for even bringing up or suggesting my life sucked because of my mom and her lying. I would regularly be sent to the hole and lose privileges. I would get in trouble for bringing it up in groups, in therapy or wherever I thought I could. My parents lied on the record in court, they did everything to hide the truth from everyone to protect my father's career in the military.
 
As my 18 birthday approached I was released from a closed custody unti where I was locked up for a year and a bit and put into a group home until I was to turn 18. On my 18th birthday I was visiting my parents and after yet another fight with my mom over something or other my father drove me to the metro, on the way he finally for the first time ever acknowledged that I wasn't his son and he was sorry he couldn't acknowledge it earlier.
 
2 lies, that forever will haunt me. 2 lies that shaped my teens and later my young adult life as the truth also sent me on another downward spiral. 2 lies that had the truth been told couldn't result in something entirely different. 2 lies that no one has even held them accountable for. Some would say they lost a son and I put them through hell. Fair, what about the hell I went through for those lies, to protect their lives.
 
My brothers didn't find out until 4 years later when they were over 18. They had gone to Germany with my parents and they lived their lives. I told them when they came back but the damage was done. I've never been able to truly reconnect with them although one brother did try his hardest and was making headway but we've gotten older, too much time has passed, we lived entirely different lives and have entirely different truths.
 
I was able to forgive my dad, my mom I'd like to forgive but to this day she still lies about it. For years she told me some guy's name, and I hunted him down but never could find him. This year DNA gave me a different name and I'm still trying to figure out how to approach him. She won't admit that lie and I can't move on without her accepting and telling me the truth. I'm told she might be too far gone for that, her loss but really she made a decision years ago and I've paid the price for it my whole life.
 
I hate liars and I managed to marry one but that's another story, if I even go post this and keep writing.
